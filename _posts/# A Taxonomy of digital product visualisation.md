# A Taxonomy of digital product visualisation
## An outline for a lecture series
In building out my skills over the last five years in product visualization both traditional and digital I have arrived at the number of observations with regard to digital product visualization. In setting out to create electro series focusing on digital product realization I thought it would be useful to lay out a taxonomy of digital product visualization as I see it.

Engaging with learning digital visualization techniques I have noticed that the learning materials tend to be heavily task focused or perhaps skill focused and the specific to the digital tool being employed. This is distinct from traditional visualization techniques which, beyond the introduction phase, tend to be objective focused and results orientated rather than focusing exclusively on skills and techniques.

I therefore Break it down digital product visualisation into four distinct categories. (I say distinct but really there are any number of combinations and iterations as with any taxonomy).

* Digital sketching
* Digital 2D rendering
* 3D concept development
* 3D product visualisation

If we look then at the objectives of product visualisation (or at least my interpretation of these objectives)

* Rapid generation and capture of ideas, problems, concept.
* Exploration of forms and examination of their utility.
* Communication of ideas and concepts.
* Presentation of a compelling vision.

My personal experience of the available teaching materials and observation of undergraduate designers leads me to the observation that the final objective hear that of presentation of a compelling vision tends to dominate the focus of the learners attention and the three other objectives are overlooked or lost in the mix.

This is out of line with the lived experience of most designers were the majority of work hours are in the first three categories of objectives and the production of high end final presentation imagery is minimised as it frequently presents very low value for money in terms of effort invested versus financial return. Analysis of student sketchbooks also shows that the majority of effort is spent in the first three sections or objectives and finished final presentation renders are often the most visible output of the design work but do not represent the bulk of the investor effort or generate a value.

This work then seeks to look at the four categories of digital product visualisation from an objective based approach and examine the outputs required to meet those objectives, the tools and skills associated with producing those outputs. Then explore the  techniques and approaches to maximise the value returns for time invested in producing this work.

All too often these digital product visualisation techniques are seen as a novelty and at undergraduate level can become a distraction that hinders engagement with progressing design solutions. 

The proposed approach seeks to place digital design visualisation in a very objectives and results focused context and as such threat them as what they are, serious and powerful design tools.
